# CREW AI EXECUTION ORDER
# Phase 1 (Parallel):
# - travel_finance_advisor_task
# - travel_intelligence_analyst_task (uses finance output)

# Phase 2 (Parallel, uses Phase 1):
# - destination_research_specialist_task
# - cultural_experience_curator_task

# Phase 3 (Uses Phase 2):
# - itinerary_planning_specialist_task

# Phase 4 (Uses Phase 3):
# - transportation_strategist_task

# Phase 5 (Uses Phase 4):
# - travel_crisis_management_task

# NOTES FOR CREW AI IMPLEMENTATION:
# 1. Use context passing between tasks - each task should receive relevant outputs from its dependencies
# 2. The Itinerary Planning Specialist is the key agent that creates the "${full_itinerary_with_dates}" that other agents need
# 3. Tasks now use web search tools instead of expecting pre-provided data like weather forecasts
# 4. Each task has clear dependencies listed to help with execution order
# 5. All variable names are now consistent between agents.yml and tasks.yml
